The tags follow this format:

Example: Lmaj 
L: Leishmania
maj: major
This notation is explained in the Materials and Methods section.

Database Structure:
Lines 1â€“433: These contain manually curated transposable element (TE) sequences recovered using RepeatModeler.
Line 437 onward: TE sequences generated by DnaPipeTE, recovered using BLASTn or BLASTx.

Additional notes:
Sequences with tags (>) indicate copies and are not curated.
Some contigs from the DnaPipeTE analysis remain uncurated as they are also copies.
The four clade are LINE/CRE, LINE/INGI, DIRS/TATE, and DIRS/VIPER.
